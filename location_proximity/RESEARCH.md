# Research Foundation: Location-Emotion Proximity Analysis

## Abstract

This document outlines the theoretical and methodological foundation for analyzing proximity in locations beyond geographic coordinates, specifically in the context of emotional recovery journeys documented through digitized memories.

## 1. Research Problem

### 1.1 Traditional Limitation
Existing location-based emotion analysis relies primarily on GPS coordinates, treating proximity as purely geographic distance. This approach fails to capture:

- **Semantic similarity**: Two churches may be far apart but functionally similar
- **Cultural context**: Places sharing cultural significance
- **Linguistic associations**: Language-specific place meanings
- **Categorical patterns**: How place types (hospitals, parks) influence emotions

### 1.2 Research Question
**"How do semantically similar locations (not just geographically proximate ones) influence emotional patterns in recovery journeys?"**

Sub-questions:
1. Can we formalize multi-dimensional proximity for location analysis?
2. Do semantically similar places evoke similar emotions across individuals?
3. What role do categorical, linguistic, and cultural dimensions play?
4. How does this understanding improve recovery journey analysis?

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Affective Geography
**Definition**: The study of how emotions are spatially distributed and how places influence emotional experiences.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Place attachment**: Emotional bonds between people and places
- **Emotional topography**: Spatial distribution of emotional experiences
- **Therapeutic landscapes**: Places that promote healing and well-being

**Application to DREAMS**:
- Recovery journeys are inherently spatial
- Certain place types may consistently evoke specific emotions
- Understanding place-emotion associations aids intervention design

### 2.2 Semantic Place Similarity
**Definition**: Similarity between locations based on meaning, function, and context rather than physical distance.

**Dimensions**:
1. **Categorical**: Place type (church, hospital, park)
2. **Functional**: Purpose served (worship, healthcare, recreation)
3. **Linguistic**: Language context and naming
4. **Cultural**: Shared cultural significance

**Relevance**:
- Enables analysis of "all churches" vs. "this specific church"
- Identifies patterns across place categories
- Supports generalization of findings

### 2.3 Recovery Narratives and Place
**Context**: Individuals in recovery often document their journey through photos and stories tied to specific locations.

**Observations**:
- Certain places become symbolic in recovery narratives
- Recurring visits to similar place types may indicate patterns
- Emotional associations with places evolve over time

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Multi-Dimensional Proximity Formalization

**Composite Proximity Score**:
```
P(L₁, L₂) = α·P_geo(L₁, L₂) + β·P_cat(L₁, L₂) + γ·P_ling(L₁, L₂) + δ·P_cult(L₁, L₂)
```

Where:
- **P_geo**: Geographic proximity (Haversine distance, normalized)
- **P_cat**: Categorical similarity (place type matching)
- **P_ling**: Linguistic similarity (language context)
- **P_cult**: Cultural similarity (Jaccard index of cultural tags)
- **α, β, γ, δ**: Weights (Σ = 1.0)

**Weight Selection**:
- Default: α=0.3, β=0.4, γ=0.15, δ=0.15
- Emphasizes categorical similarity (place type)
- Adjustable based on research focus

### 3.2 Categorical Similarity Calculation

**Exact Match**: Same place type → 1.0
```
P_cat(church, church) = 1.0
```

**Related Categories**: Functionally similar → 0.5
```
P_cat(hospital, clinic) = 0.5
```

**Different Categories**: Unrelated → 0.0
```
P_cat(church, hospital) = 0.0
```

**Category Groups**:
- Religious: {church, temple, mosque, synagogue}
- Healthcare: {hospital, clinic, pharmacy}
- Recreation: {park, garden, beach}
- Food & Drink: {restaurant, cafe, bar}

### 3.3 Emotion-Location Association Mining

**Data Structure**:
```
EmotionLocationEntry = {
    location_id: str,
    sentiment: {'positive', 'negative', 'neutral'},
    score: float [0-1],
    timestamp: datetime,
    place_type: str,
    user_id: str
}
```

**Analysis Methods**:

1. **Location Sentiment Profile**:
   - Aggregate all visits to a location
   - Calculate sentiment distribution
   - Identify dominant emotion

2. **Emotional Hotspots**:
   - Locations with consistent emotional associations
   - Threshold: ≥60% of visits share same sentiment
   - Minimum visits: 3

3. **Place Type Comparison**:
   - Aggregate emotions by place category
   - Calculate percentage distributions
   - Identify category-emotion patterns

### 3.4 Semantic Clustering

**Algorithm**: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)

**Rationale**:
- No need to predefine cluster count
- Handles noise (outlier locations)
- Works with proximity matrix

**Parameters**:
- **eps**: Maximum distance for neighborhood (0.3-0.5)
- **min_samples**: Minimum points for core point (2-3)

**Process**:
1. Calculate proximity matrix for all locations
2. Convert proximity to distance: D = 1 - P
3. Apply DBSCAN with precomputed distance matrix
4. Analyze emotional patterns within clusters
